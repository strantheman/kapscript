Configure Settings

Before pasting and running the script, set your Max HP, Max MP, Rest, and Run values.

settings:
health_rest: 0.90 - this will rest until you are at 90% of your Max HP
health_run: 0.69 - this will run when you are below 69% of your Max HP
base: 
health: 27 - this sets your Max HP to 27
mana: 3 - this sets your Max MP to 3
Recommended Usage
Add the script to your browser so it always runs for you without you having to copy / paste. I can provide more detailed instructions or assistance for how to set this up. I personally use Firefox + Greasemonkey.

Install a UserScript plugin for your browser such as Greasemonkey for Firefox
Create a new script and copy KapScript_v0.1.user.js contents into that file.
Enable the script in the plugin dropdown
Enter the realm as normal
